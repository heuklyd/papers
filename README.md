# Papers

This project, online at [https://heuklyd.github.io/papers/](https://heuklyd.github.io/papers/) gathers a few digitized mathematical papers of the 20th century, which are either hard to find online, or only available with low-quality typesetting. The goal is to make these works more easily accessible and more pleasant to read.

## Typesetting

The papers are typeset using LaTeX2e by a combination of automated and manual conversion from the original historical versions.

The original layout and style of the papers are roughly respected. The equations and text are unchanged, except for small typos (both in text and equations) which are corrected when encountered.

The GitHub repository contains the source files.

Please feel free to contribute by adding other new papers or correcting typos in the existing ones.
